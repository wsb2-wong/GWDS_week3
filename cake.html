        <h1>I love cake. I'm not afraid to shout it to the mountain top.</h1>

        <p class="cake-text">That's right. I love all kinds of cake. Chocolate, vanilla, cherry, and fruit based. If there is extra frosting or marzipan, all the better. I would happily run a 5k if there was cake at the finish line.</p>

            <p class="cake-text dark center">Here are six different versions of cake and cake-like products. I would happily eat them all. Marcarons are different than macaroons, and are considerably more difficult to make from scratch. They were all the rage in Montreal when I lived there. As an aside, these images are proportionate to an A3 piece of paper. Handy to know for one of your tasks. Think about it.</p>

        <p class="cake-text caption disclaimer dark">In conclusion: cake. Love it. Also, it is this easy to plan and make a
            website with images of projects and some feedback text. With just a little planning, you can do this. Now
            take a week off from programming. You deserve it.</p>
